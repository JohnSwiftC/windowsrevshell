# windowsrevshell
Reverse shell client and listener built for Windows.
# Warning!!!
I built this to get more familiar with some low level networking concepts! Using this on unaware machines is illegal (and probably not great for persistance either!)
Some vendors will completely flag this as malware!
# Usage
Build with VS, look at macros for some specific info on options.


*PS, if you actually want to do this, just use netcat!*
