# windowsrevshell
Reverse shell client and listener built for Windows.
# Warning!!!
I built this to get more familiar with some low level networking concepts! Using this on unaware machines is illegal (and probably not great for persistance either!)
Some vendors will completely flag this as malware!
# Usage
Fill in definitions for your IP address and port!
If this is to be used outside of your local network, look into port forwarding and use a public facing ipv4! ~maybe learn networking yourself before trying to use tools like this ;)

On the server/listener, you will be prompted as to which shell to spawn on the victim machine, I like either cmd or powershell but the world really is your oyster (all 30 bytes of it)
